            <h1>Terms Of Use</h1>


            <p>Welcome to EasyLoanDay.com. EasyLoanDay.com ("NextPaydayAdvance") operates a Web site located at https://www.EasyLoanDay.com (also referred to as "the Site") which provides a connection between people seeking payday loans and payday advance providers online who provide these short term loans.</p>
            <p>NextPaydayAdvance is not a financial institution or a lender. The information you provide to NextPaydayAdvance may be placed with one of several independent loan companies. NextPaydayAdvance cannot guarantee final approval of unsecured cash loans. Not all independent loan companies will approve you for a loan or can provide you with up to $1,500 on your first loan. Qualifying for final approval of a cash loan depends on various factors including income and the state in which you reside. Payday loan charges vary by lender. Remember short term payday loans are designed to provide you with short term financing to solve immediate cash flow problems and should not be considered a long term solution.</p>
            <p>These terms of use ("TOU"), together with the NextPaydayAdvance&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;constitute a binding agreement - and the only agreement - between you and NextPaydayAdvance governing your use of the Site. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the TOU. By using this Site, you also acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of our&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;and agree to said terms.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree to these TOU, please do not enter the Site. NextPaydayAdvance may also modify the TOU at any time, without notice. Any modifications will be posted on this page, so we suggest you return to this page on a regular basis to view the TOU. Your continued use of the Site after any modification will mean you agree to the TOU as modified. If you do not agree to a modification, you should stop using the Site immediately. If NextPaydayAdvance believes you have breached these TOU, NextPaydayAdvance may, without notice, suspend or terminate your ability to access the Site.</p>
            <p>Authorized uses. NextPaydayAdvance authorizes you to use this Site solely for your own personal, non-commercial use. Any other use is strictly prohibited. You agree not to access, reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes any material at the Site. The Site is not directed at children under 18 years of age. Any use of the Site by anyone under 18 years of age is unauthorized and in violation of these TOU.</p>
            <p>Proprietary Rights. Everything that appears on the Site is protected under the intellectual property laws of the United States and may not be used except as provided in these TOU. NextPaydayAdvance neither represents nor warrants that your use of materials displayed at the Site will not infringe rights of third parties.</p>
            <p>Trademark Information. The trademarks, logos, and service marks (collectively the "Trademarks") displayed on the Site, are registered and unregistered Trademarks of NextPaydayAdvance and others. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark displayed on the Site without the written permission of NextPaydayAdvance or such third party that may own the Trademarks displayed on the Site. You are also advised NextPaydayAdvance will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law, including the seeking of criminal prosecution.</p>
            <p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by NextPaydayAdvance infringe your copyright, you, or your agent, may send NextPaydayAdvance notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon NextPaydayAdvance actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send NextPaydayAdvance a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see&nbsp;https://www.copyright.gov/&nbsp;for details.</p>
            <p>Inaccuracies at the Site. While NextPaydayAdvance uses reasonable efforts to include accurate and up to date information at the Site, NextPaydayAdvance makes no warranties or representations as to the Site's accuracy. NextPaydayAdvance disclaims any and all liability for the accuracy, completeness, or correctness of such information.</p>
            <p>Security at the Site. While NextPaydayAdvance uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of the Site, there can be no guaranty that such safeguards will successfully prevent unauthorized alterations in the content or functionality of the Site. NextPaydayAdvance assumes no responsibility for any unauthorized alterations in the content or functionality of the Site.</p>
            <p>Disclaimer of Warranties. NextPaydayAdvance MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SITE OR THE PAYDAY LOANS THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE. THE SITE AND INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the exclusion of implied warranties.</p>
            <p>Limitation of Liability. NextPaydayAdvance shall not be liable for any damages to, or viruses that may infect, your computer equipment or other property on account of your access to, use of, or browsing in the Site. Your use of the Site is at your own risk. NextPaydayAdvance is not a financial advisor or institution, and shall not have any liability or responsibility for the decision to accept a payday loan through use of the Site. NextPaydayAdvance SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO, OR USE OF, THE SITE. IN NO EVENT SHALL NextPaydayAdvance' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR USING THE SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE.</p>
            <p>Jurisdictional Issues. NextPaydayAdvance makes no representation that materials on the Site are appropriate or available for use in locations other than the United States. Those who choose to access the Site from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Although you may access our Site from anywhere in the United States, payday loans are not available to residents of certain states, including New York and West Virginia.</p>
            <p>Monitoring, Copying, Altering or Interfering With the Site. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, Web crawler, screen scraper, automated query program or other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy our web pages or the content contained herein without our prior expressed written permission. You agree that you will not use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site. You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.</p>
            <p>General Information. These TOU shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these TOU shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provisions of these TOU shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then the provision shall be deemed severable from these TOU and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>
